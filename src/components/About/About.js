              NITMUN is a forum convened by the members of the Literary Circle
              for discussion and analysis of global issues. It seeks to bring
              out motivated delegates from all over the country for
              brainstorming and discussing over significant international
              issues. Organised by the Literary Circle, NITMUN promises a
              challenging yet a very entertaining time to all delegates. It
              requires the entire workforce of the club to come up with a topic
              or a committee that really instigates each and every delegate to
              ponder. And then, the best executive boards from all over the
              country are brought together to make sure that every delegate
              grows and becomes better at the end of the conference. Our
              greatest goal is to make sure that each delegate learns how to
              tackle world issues better at the end of the conference as the
              world is in dire need of young leaders now. Currently in its 9th
              edition, NITMUN has been extremely successful in providing the
              perfect experience to each delegate. Over the years, we have
              entertained more than 1000 delegates in total. Delegates arrive
              from all corners of India for an experience they will never
              forget.
